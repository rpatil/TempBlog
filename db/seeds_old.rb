Motion UI</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The new age of flat design has, in many ways, taken something away from our interfaces: hierarchy and structure due to the lack of gradients, skeuomorphic elements, shadows and depth. Foundation for Apps tackles this problem by using a rich Motion UI library with tons of animations and transitions ready for you to use. You won&rsquo;t have to mess about with Sass or JavaScript, because ZURB has done the hard work for you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n", "content_short_introduction"=>"ZURB is always working on the next big tool to help web designers and developers alike.
